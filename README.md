My attempt at making a web worker to scrape class availability through UNLV's garbage website. This project was made with nodejs and puppeteer. Initially worked with multiple classes, but ran into errors with concurrent browsing. To try and solve this issue, I tried to make a job queue with bee-queue. Still ran into errors. Will try and make V2 soon i hate unlv
